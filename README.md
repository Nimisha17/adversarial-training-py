# adversarial-training-py
Lightweight Python demos of adversarial attacks (random perturbations, FGSM, PGD) and adversarial training.

This repository is a work-in-progress and contains compact, easy-to-read Python scripts demonstrating how to generate adversarial examples and how to train models with adversarial examples for improved robustness.
